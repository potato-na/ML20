We use the harmonic mean because both indicators have the same numerator but different denominators. Thus, a mean that put emphasis on the difference between those 2 indicators is the harmonic mean. This is roughly equivalent as taking the arithmetic mean of false positives and false negatives. This means that false positives and false negatives are of equal importance when the number of true positives stay the same.
